Pico HID Keyboard
=================


A small server running on a Raspberry Pi Pico W receives requests and simulates keyboard/mouse input to the machine connected to it. It can be used to remotely control another machineâ€™s keyboard and mouse at the hardware level.


Dependencies
------------

CircuitPython, https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/README.html  


Hardware Requirements
---------------------

1. Raspberry Pi Pico W  
2. USB cable (micro USB to USB-A/C to connect to PC)  


Setup
-----

1. Setup the CricuitPython for Raspberry Pi Pico W.  
   Press and hold the button on the Pico, connect to PC/Macbook
   Drag-and-drop the [.uf2 file](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/) to the `RPI-RP2` drive.
   It will auto reboot with a CircultPython environment.

2. Copy `lib`, `code.py`, in `settings.toml` setup WiFi SSID and password, copy them to the board.  

Re-power it.  
Done.  


API Interface
-------------

Scan the local network, and find the Pico board IP.  
Send POST request to the board IP, port 8080.  

* Keyboard  

Send with raw text: `keycode=your_key_code` to trigger key input.  
Send `typing=your_text_string` to trigger string input.  
Keycode support:  
1. Alphabet (lower/upper)  
2. Function keys, `F1` ~ `F12`  
3. Arrow Keys  
   Keycode is `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`  
4. Numbers and Symbols  
5. Enter, Space, Tab key.  
   Keycode is `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`  

Use the `,` to separate keys.  
For example, `keycode=TAB,ENTER` will trigger Tab key then Enter key.  

* Mouse

Send with raw text: `mouse=mouse_event` to trigger mouse input.  
Mouse event support:  
1. Click  
   `CLICK(x,y)`, `RIGHT_CLICK(x,y)`, `DOUBLE_CLICK(x,y)`  
   Click the current position use `LEFT_CLICK(0,0)`
2. Move  
   `MOVE(x,y)`  
Note: the `x` and `y` is relative coordinate.  


Client Code
-----------

There is a client example code (`client.go`) written in Go language.  
You can add your own code in `main()`.  

To use it first setup with:

`go mod init pico-hid`  
`go get github.com/joho/godotenv`  

Add server URL in `.env` as,  
`PICO_HID_SERVER_URL=your_server_url`  

Run it with `go run client_example.go`.
